Of course there was a period where she waited further into my apprenticeship before she wanted me to tattoo her, but she’d been mentioning it since day one. The way she described this tattoo made it seem like she was wanting to invest her time into an entire* back piece. Now, little ol’me is over here sweating bullets because I know my mom only has one tattoo (that butterfly on the back of her neck) and hasn’t gotten another one for probably 20 years. So, for me, I always sat there and said, “No way. You’ll never sit through it and there’s no way I’m going to attempt to re-line the stencil up with whatever you have when you tap.” There’s also this giant part of me that didn’t want to start the process because, inevitably, it would mean covering up her tattoo that my dad drew for her when they were together, and he was alive. It’s also the same tattoo that I have behind my left ear (minus the color) so it’s technically also a matching tattoo that I have with my mom that connects me to not only her, but my dad. So long story short, she talked me into starting the process (which was WAY WAY WAY) smaller than what she’d been talking it up to be for years even before my tattoo career. This is all she could sit through — which I already knew (funny how the daughter was right, right?) and the second picture is when she asked if it was done already. *erupts into wicked laughter* — Anyways, I’m going to try and talk her out of the cover-up because of what it means to me, even though she hates it. Touchy subject, but she’s my mom, she punched me in the face (not during the tattoo! I was 14, calm down.) The least she can do after bringing my miserable ass into existence is keep a tattoo. I’ll even give her more to distract her from the one. 😂 #tattoo #tattooingmymom #mom #storytime #inked #inkedgirls #dragon #tatted #tattooed #linework #livingcanvas',\n"," 'Had the chance to upgrade a few pieces  of jewelry in these ladies ears today, some nice blue sapphire tops and a matching set of 🌙 moon crescent Daith jewelry.
